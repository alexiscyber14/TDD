<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 Test Driven Design/TDD <a name="about-project"></a>

**Test Driven Design/TDD Project** Is about a software development approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing the actual code. The process begins by creating a test that defines the desired behavior of a specific piece of functionality. Initially, the test will fail since the corresponding code does not exist. Developers then implement the code necessary to make the test pass, and refactor it as needed to improve its design and maintainability. The cycle of writing tests, implementing code, and refactoring is repeated for each desired feature or change. TDD promotes a systematic and incremental development process that ensures code is thoroughly tested and meets the specified requirements.

### Key Features <a name="key-features"></a>

- **Automated tests: The project will have a comprehensive suite of automated tests covering different aspects of the codebase. These tests are executed regularly to catch any regressions or issues that may arise during development.**

- **Incremental development: TDD promotes an incremental approach where functionality is implemented in small increments. Each increment is driven by a failing test, ensuring that new code is only added to satisfy specific requirements.**

- **Clear specification: Tests serve as a specification for the desired behavior of the code. They act as living documentation, providing clear examples of how the code should behave in different scenarios.**

- **Improved code quality: Writing tests before code encourages developers to think about design, modularity, and the desired API of the code. This often leads to more maintainable and loosely coupled code.**

- **Refactoring support: TDD encourages regular refactoring to improve code quality without introducing bugs. With a suite of tests in place, developers can confidently refactor their code, knowing that any regression issues will be caught by the tests.**
